The group employs 272,000 people and generates around €35B per year. On an average day, the train company operates 15,000 trains that transport roughly 10 million passengers around France: a truly massive footprint!</p><p>e.Voyageurs SNCF is the subsidiary responsible for the railway company’s ticketing system and online sales platform (Oui.sncf), which processes 110 million tickets per year, accounting for nearly €5B in total annual sales.</p><p>At e.Voyageurs SNCF, Anne-Laure Jean supervises product management for two Agile development teams (a total of 17 developers, QA testers, and product owners) that work on complex backend products. Mohamed Moussa is a Scrum Master in one of these teams, responsible for spreading Agile philosophy and best practices across SNCF’s Digital Factory.</p><img class=\"illustration right-sided\" src=\"./imgs/MUT_Customers/customer_evoyageurs/2_IMG_20200831_121410.jpg\" alt=\"Management and monitoring whiteboard\"><h2>“Did we forget an essential part of the product?”</h2><p>As Agile methodologies were introduced to the Factory, product owners were appointed in development teams almost overnight, without them having previous experience in that role. Some of them had a good intuition about which new product features were on the roadmap. Others lacked enough of a big picture view to get a clear understanding of the coming product and technical challenges. This created frustration for dev engineers who often find themselves having to make structural choices in terms of technical architecture without being able to envision all the consequences.</p><p>“Did we forget an essential part of the product?” was the question that kept Anne-Laure awake at night. With many inputs from various business owners, she faced a sensitive challenge for sorting things out in a meaningful way without letting key business insights aside.</p><p>It became clear that “product owners needed a tool to help get a broader view of which user stories were truly needed to solve midterm product development questions,” said Anne-Laure. By getting all of these details “on paper” in story map form, product owners were then able to provide their teams with the guidance they needed to better anticipate the eventual evolution of the product roadmap.</p><p>At that time, developers and QA testers claimed that “during grooming sessions, we only had a line of sight into the user stories coming in the next sprint, but not beyond that,” Mohamed explained. It’s at this point that he encouraged product owners to begin doing <a href=\"https://draft.io/example/user-story-mapping\" class=\"text-link advanced-underline-over\"><span>User</span> <span>Story</span> <span>Mapping</span></a>.</p><img class=\"illustration left-sided\" src=\"./imgs/MUT_Customers/customer_evoyageurs/3_story_mapping_structure.png\" alt=\"Story mapping illustration\"><h2>“Helping people speak the same language”</h2><p>Once User Story Mapping was introduced in development teams, “it became clear that it was an ideal tool for helping product owners think in more detail about the products their teams were developing and organize their work in a smarter way,” said Mohamed.</p><p>Mohamed has long appreciated User Story Mapping because “it encourages teams to work with a common tool, creating a unique source of truth that helps everyone involved, whether business owners or development teams, finally speak the same language and enables product owners to better grasp the big picture in order to define user stories more wisely.”</p><p>The first priority was to map the needs of the entire project. Anne-Laure and Mohamed soon realized that they needed to adapt User Story Mapping to more clearly visualize the “problem space” (business owners) from the “solution space” (product owners).</p><p>Then, they put a new process in place whereby business owners were asked to regularly present their needs to the team in the form of User Story Maps and product owners were tasked with their development teams to determine the right solutions to present to stakeholders (not only business owners). The goal here was to create a collaborative and virtuous feedback loop.</p><p>In her role as a product manager, Anne-Laure helps business owners ideate and capture future product needs in the form of User Story Maps. And while this new process is, admittedly, on a bit of a learning curve for the entire team, she hopes that “User Story Mapping will progressively become a default tool for product development workflows moving forward.”</p><p>“Thanks to product owners and with the help of Anne-Laure, User Story Mapping has unified development teams harmoniously with the other parts of the business,” expressed Mohamed with a great deal of satisfaction.</p><h2>“Standardizing language from management to QA testers”</h2><p>So, what are the next steps? “We want to standardize the project management process in terms of ‘epics’ between business owners and development teams, in order to help stakeholders be able to follow up project progress more effectively,” explained Mohamed.</p><p>By taking advantage of the Jira integration with Draft, Mohamed’s next objective is to “standardize language from management to QA testers and sync up Draft’s epics cards with those available on Jira, to create a genuine, end-to-end continuity in the project management process from decision-makers to doers.”</p>"

The company offers accident, health, property, and liability insurance coverage. Sympany’s 500 employees oversee more than 260,000 customer relationships, amounting to around CHF 1 billion (~USD 1.1 billion) in revenues from insurance premiums alone.</p><p>The company started a cultural shift two years ago by introducing a common Agile-at-scale framework—SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)—into its business operations. The key objective of making this change was to break down the walls between departments and bring more transparency around achievements and issues across the company’s management and development teams. Sympany’s Agile Transformation Manager, Julian Gerstacker has led the charge of this from the very start.</p><p>The decision to move in this direction was a decisive moment aimed at ensuring the sustainability and future success of this century-old business. “Many startups have launched recently with the objective of revolutionizing the insurance experience. Sympany had to find ways of being more flexible to adapt to circumstances and eventually get ahead of the market,” Julian points out.</p><img class=\"illustration right-sided\" src=\"./imgs/MUT_Customers/customer_sympany/2_Sympany_Program_Board_201906.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration de programm board\"><h2>“PI Planning forces us to define clearer goals that make issues obvious while encouraging increased accountability.”</h2><p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic rattled the world, 10 different Scrum and Kanban teams used to meet every 10 weeks for a two-day PI Planning session. This meeting would take place in a large hotel conference room where the roughly 80-person development team, plus other key stakeholders would spend the two-day stretch collaborating on ideas and putting sticky-notes all over the place. During these meetings, a large conference room wall was essentially transformed into the team’s living <a href=\"https://draft.io/example/program-board\" class=\"text-link advanced-underline-over\"><span>Program</span> <span>Board</span></a>.</p><p>This all changed when lockdown measures were enforced and most of Sympany’s employees had to begin working from home. After trying to build a virtual Program Board via a dedicated Jira add-on unsuccessfully, Julian made the switch to Draft to build a comprehensive PI Planning Board. This included an agenda, a Program Board, and a Risk Roaming matrix. Combined with Microsoft Teams’ virtual meeting capabilities, much of what once required physical interaction could now be replicated effectively in the digital space.</p><p>For Julian, the Scaled Agile Framework process has revolutionized his team’s ability to collaborate seamlessly, even in a 100% virtual capacity: “PI Planning forces us to define clearer goals that make issues obvious while encouraging increased accountability.” In addition to Draft, he documents all the processes in Confluence—increment by increment—to track every decision and change to the initial plan easily.</p><h2>Staying focused on driving valuable, organization-wide outcomes</h2><p>Between every PI Planning—and in addition to ongoing Scrum or Kanban ceremonies at the team level—Julian implemented a tailor-made process for maximizing team alignment, enabling everyone to “see the bigger picture and to focus on driving valuable, organization-wide outcomes rather than tackling team-specific priorities in various siloes.” This process consisted of three separate meetings, each occurring every two weeks:</p><ol><li>PMBSO (Product Management, Business and Service Owners) meetings to collect requirements from all of Sympany’s divisions. These meetings feed a Portfolio Kanban centralizing the features needed for the next increments.</li><li>Stakeholder meetings that assemble all key project players. These facilitate the flow of information between departments, which can be decisive in triggering new opportunities or identifying problematic organizational issues.</li><li>PO-Sync (Product Owners) meetings to ensure that all teams are on-track. These are important because it allows us to “focus on the changes and dependencies that need to be discussed with other teams,” explains Julian.</li></ol><img class=\"illustration left-sided\" src=\"./imgs/MUT_Customers/customer_sympany/3_Sympany_Problem_Solving_workshop.jpg\" alt=\"Atelier résolution de problèmes\"><h2>The impact of remote PI Planning</h2><p>According to Julian, shifting to remote PI Planning has lost both the flexibility and spontaneity of team communications as well as a shared sense of ownership in the end-to-end process. Even so, the benefits of this still offset the detriments. Now he’s able to document PI Planning far better than ever before, making it easier for everyone on the team to keep track of all of the actions and decisions made during those meetings.</p><p>And finally, being able to share the outcomes of PI Planning meetings—including the latest version of the roadmap—to management and stakeholders, Julian has become much more than just the “sticky-note guy,” which can be the perception at the beginning of any Agile transformation. Now, he’s indisputably viewed as a strategic asset to the entire team.</p><p>Draft made it possible to replace those expensive creative collaboration spaces covered in sticky-notes and provide Sympany with a better and more innovative way to work and collaborate. Julian sums it up nicely, “Everyone can now be creative at home.”</p><h2>What are the next steps?</h2><p>“I want to bring Agile philosophy to every decision-making layer of the organization in order to help innovative ideas sprout from the bottom up,” even knowing that this can be a huge challenge to overcome in typically hierarchical Swiss businesses.</p><p>Additionally, to avoid Jira’s inherent constraints around the freedom and skills required to put project management tools in place, Julian “will also help teams build their own visual management artifacts on Draft,” including customized <a href=\"https://draft.io/example/kanban-board\" class=\"text-link advanced-underline-over\"><span>Kanban</span> <span>boards</span></a>.”</p>"

This division employs around 44 000 people and operates 15 train lines, few trams and buses within the region. Two of the lines are co-managed with the RATP, the state-owned rail network serving Paris and its suburbs.</p><p>Although Transilien only serves one region in France, its rail network makes up half of the combined distance traveled by all passenger trains in France every day, accounting for 7 out of 10 of the SNCF’s daily passengers (more than 3.5 Millions commuters, and 5200 trains, per day).</p><p>In 2016, Transilien’s IT department kicked off an ambitious initiative to adopt Agile methodologies across all of its projects—and to do so within a matter of a few years. Pierre Watier, Manager in charge of Innovation and Agility transformation, has set up a task force team of seasoned experts composed of five Agile Coaches, one Coach in Agile testing, one Organizational Coach, and one Design Thinking Consultant. They work across the 400-person IT department and are tasked with helping teams to choose the right frameworks and implement them in a way that fits their context.</p><p>Maxime Bonnet, Agile Coach at CGI, a Canadian global IT consulting and systems integration company, just happens to be one of these people. For the last four years, he has led the charge within the train operation division of Transilien’s IT department.</p><p>This division has three key objectives:</p><ol><li>Preparing the network’s train schedule and doing whatever it takes to ensure all trains run on-time as much as possible;</li><li>Handling train maintenance, so that trains are travel-ready at all times; and</li><li>Monitoring traffic across the rail network to provide senior management and other French authorities performance updates throughout the day.</li></ol><img class=\"illustration right-sided\" src=\"./imgs/MUT_Customers/customer_transilien/2_Meeting.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration\"><h2>“Our PI Planning process also got senior management more involved…which forced them to take more responsibility and accountability for the trade-offs they suggested making.”</h2><p>Maxime oversees a program involving 180 employees distributed across 13 different project teams. With the exception of one large team working on an ERP deployment, all project teams follow the Agile framework (Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming).</p><p>Each team is made up of five to nine people, including one Product Owner (from the business), one Proxy Product Owner (from the IT department), one Scrum Master, and a few Developers. They work on projects ranging from thick-client application development to data mining and reporting tool development to projects related to their microservice-based infrastructure.</p><p>Since implementing Agile frameworks to the team’s day-to-day operations, they have completed a total of eight PI Planning sessions (four in-person and four remote). These occur every three months, with a series of three separate four-week sprints in between each.</p><p>Prior to COVID-19, 70 team members would meet live in Paris for a full-day PI Planning once every three months. To avoid needing to dedicate the typical two days required for these types of meetings, they established a best practice to share new features with the entire team at least two weeks in advance of the scheduled PI Planning. This gives all team members an opportunity to estimate the time required to develop and deploy those features and, therefore, come to the session with a clear point of view about how best to approach them.</p><p>Streamlining PI Planning in this way allowed all teams present to be more productive by spending the day filling in the Solution Board together. “Our PI Planning process also got senior management more involved and engaged in this work. Allowing them to collaborate with the entire team in this way—and land on important decisions together—forced them to take more responsibility and accountability for the trade-offs they suggested making,” explained Maxime.</p><h2>“To prevent ‘video conference fatigue,’ we had to find ways of using time and space differently.”</h2><p>When the first COVID-19 lockdown occurred back in March, there were only three weeks to go before the next PI Planning. The pressure was on to find an immediate solution. But Maxime felt “it would be impossible to keep the full attention of participants during an all-day remote workshop. So to prevent <a href=\"https://medium.com/@alex.beauchet/zoom-fatigue-is-not-about-zoom-16c742ecea6\" class=\"text-link advanced-underline-over\"><span>video</span> <span>conference</span> <span>fatigue</span></a>, we had to find ways of using time and space differently.” This led them to split their typical one-day PI Planning session into a series of several shorter meetings over a two-week period of time.</p><p>Two weeks before the first of these shorter PI Planning meetings, features relevant to the next increment are now sent to project teams for consideration and estimation. Each team cuts these features into big user stories to identify the work required to deliver on them. Finally, the teams come together to collaborate on a Project Board, where the user stories are arranged along a simple timeline: sprint 1, sprint 2, sprint 3, and overtime.</p><p>On the day before PI Planning officially begins, a ‘speed dating’ process takes place between the Release Train Engineer (RTE)—supported by Agile Coaches—and the Product Owner of each project team. This involves the RTE and Agile Coaches collecting the teams’ Project Boards and summarizing them into a master Solution Board—which makes it easier to visualize dependencies between big user stories across teams and identify potential bottlenecks.</p><p>This first version of the Solution Board is finally presented to the epic owner, business owners, and cross-project product managers—who then adjust the features and the Solution Board based on perceived dependencies and bottlenecks. This final version of the Solution Board is then presented by senior management to the entire 180-person team joining the now-remote PI Planning session.“We’ve successfully designed a tailor-made Agile-at-scale framework, inspired mainly by SAFe® but also by LeSS and Scrum-of-Scrum frameworks,” says Maxime.</p><img class=\"illustration left-sided\" src=\"./imgs/MUT_Customers/customer_transilien/1_Transilien-Atelier_Role_et_Interactions.png\" alt=\"Illustration\"><h2>The challenge of evolving PI Planning in a remote world</h2><p>Maxime considers himself to be a “sticky-note guy.” He loves how sticky-notes inherently get people more involved and tend to make them more accountable for what they say. This is why he believes that retrospectives have lost their “sense of commitment” after migrating to digital tools. But not everyone always likes using sticky-notes either. This is especially the case among senior managers who oftentimes find them to be a bit childish.</p><p>By using a collaborative virtual board like Draft, Maxime has seen a boost in participation during these PI Planning sessions, especially among senior managers. Additionally, it has allowed his teams to document PI Planning better by giving them an easier way to organize and archive all visual management digital artifacts. All in all, the remote PI Planning sessions have become a more satisfying and productive experience for Transilien’s entire IT team. By giving everyone more time to prepare in advance—and to think through features or critical problems deeply—the end result has been a more productive and actionable process than ever before.</p><p>However, Maxime underscores that if it hadn’t been for the in-person PI Planning sessions prior to COVID-19, these remote sessions wouldn’t have been as successful. Those in-person experiences created a strong group dynamic and a sense of cohesion that made the transition into remote PI Planning seamless. This is why Maxime hopes that his team will be able to begin doing these sessions in-person again soon—with the help of Draft to streamline the process—to maintain those solid relationships while still driving a high level of efficiency.</p>"
