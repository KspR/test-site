        "q": "Can I use Draft for free?",
        "a": "Yes, you can start using Draft now for free by signing up for a Free plan. It gives you access to 500 free items (across unlimited drafts), unlimited sharing, and more."
      },
      "q3": {
        "q": "What do you mean by an ‘unlimited number’ of guests?",
        "a": "Each draft you create comes equipped with its own URL. Regardless of the plan you’re on, you can grant access to your drafts to as many people as you want—whether they are Draft users or not—just by sharing the URL. There are no apps to download. There is no registration required. Just share a link and start collaborating with whomever you choose, instantly."
      },
      "q4": {
        "q": "What's the difference between the Free and Pro plans?",
        "a": "The biggest difference between these two plans is based on how much content you can add to your drafts. In the Free plan, you can create up to 500 items across all of your drafts. In the Pro plan, there are no limits whatsoever."
      },
      "q5": {
        "q": "Does Draft keep my data secure?",
        "a": "Yes, our number one priority is to ensure your data is secure at all times. We use HTTPS protocol with TLSv1.2 or higher in transit and AES 256 at rest to give you peace of mind."

        "q": "I want to use Draft for my team. What does the Team plan include?",

Key features include: <ul style=\"margin-left:20px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;\"><li>Shared Sync Folder System: Anyone in a team can create folders to share easily with each other or with outside stakeholders (i.e. freelancers, agencies, customers, etc.).</li><li>Rich User Roles: Assign the right roles to each user within your Draft team, including manager, content manager, contributor, and viewer.</li></ul>The Draft sync folder sharing system for teams is just as convenient and easy-to-use as other common file sharing tools like Dropbox or Google Drive. "

        "q": "What is a ‘team member’ in a Team plan?",
